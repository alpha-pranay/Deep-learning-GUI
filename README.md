# Deeplearning GUI
==============

This graphical user interface allows you to create your own models on the browser without any knowledge of the programming languages.
This project is made on Tensorflow.js and allows you to create new model or use transfer learning to create model on top of existing models.  
<br>

Currently only mobilenet is added to it to create model on top of it, that means it restricts you to only computer vision tasks.  
But soon, NLP based layers and models will be available to create simple chatbots and test them on the go-on the browser itself.  

## How to use:  
Go to the website: [Deep learning GUI](https://prashant9316.github.io/Deep-learning-GUI/)
You don't need to know how to use it.  
Just go to website, choose your base model to upon, start adding layers.  
Optimize it with your optimizer and loss functions and then compile it.  
After that your model is ready to show you the summary.  
Click on summary to open model summary.
